# My Machine Learning Project
A Machine Learning Algorithm deployed to predict the propensity to churn for each customer of a bank.
Problem Statement and Dataset included in repository.

This Repo contains the following files
1. Notebook.ipynb
   This Jupyter Python Notebook contains the implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms like (K-NN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier) to figure out the propensity of a customer of a bank to churn (Customer churn is the percentage of customers who stopped purchasing your business's products or services during a certain period of time.)

2. churn_prediction.csv
   This is the main dataset I used for training and testing my model.

3. Final Project Problem Statement
   This file contains the details of the Problem Statement, we are supposed to solve using Machine Learning.



I have used Python Language and Jupyter Notebook for this Project.
The following Python Libraries have been leveraged for this.
Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, sklearn

The following Machine Learning Algorithms have been used
K-NN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier

Since our problem statement dictated us to deal with categorical label
classification algorithms were used

Furthurmore, we have used Techniques such as Ensembling to increase our Model Accuracy
